Before you can create tasks and execute coding agents, you must create a project.

## Creating Your Project
Click the **Create Project** button to choose from two options:
- **From existing git repository**: Browse your file system and select from a list of git repositories sorted by recent activity
- **Create blank project**: Generate a new git repository from scratch
Each project represents a git repository. After creation, you can configure it with setup scripts, dev server scripts, and other settings.


<Note>
After creating a project, you need to press the settings button in the top right to configure project scripts and settings.

## Project Settings

Once you've created a project, you can access the project settings by clicking the settings button in the top right corner. From here, you can configure various aspects of your project.

### Setup Scripts

Setup scripts will be run before the coding agent is executed. This is useful for installing dependencies, for example you might run `npm install` or `cargo build`. This will save you time as your agent won't need to figure out that these commands haven't already been run.

<Note>
Each time a coding agent is executed it runs in a [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) which is unlikely to contain your dependencies, configs, .env etc.
</Note>

### Dev Server Scripts

The dev server script is run whenever you press the "run dev server" button. It's useful for quickly reviewing work after a coding agent has run.

### Copy Files

Comma-separated list of files to copy from the original project directory to the worktree. These files will be copied after the worktree is created but before the setup script runs. Useful for environment-specific files like `.env`, configuration files, and local settings.

<Warning>
Make sure these files are gitignored or they could get committed!
</Warning>

### Project Task Templates

From project settings, you can also configure project-specific task templates. For more details about this feature, see the [project task templates section](/configuration-customisation/creating-task-templates#project-task-templates).

### Cleanup Scripts

Cleanup scripts run after a coding agent finishes. You can use these to tidy up the workspace, remove temporary files, or perform any post-execution cleanup. For example, you might run:

```bash
npm run clean
```

Cleanup scripts only run when the agent produced file changes. When no modifications were made the cleanup script is skipped.

### Script environment for multi-repository projects

Setup, cleanup, and dev server scripts always start in the primary repository worktree. If the project uses a root override the script begins inside that directory. Use the exported environment variables to reach other repositories:

- `VIBE_PRIMARY_REPO_PATH` and `VIBE_PRIMARY_REPO_ROOT` – primary worktree path and optional subdirectory root
- `VIBE_REPOSITORIES` – comma-separated environment prefixes for each linked repository
- `VIBE_REPO_<PREFIX>_PATH` / `VIBE_REPO_<PREFIX>_ROOT` – worktree path and optional root for a specific repository

The snippet below installs dependencies across every linked repository. Uncomment or adapt the loop for your own scripts.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Setup script (macOS/Linux)
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Start inside the primary repository worktree (honours root overrides).
cd "${VIBE_PRIMARY_REPO_PATH}/${VIBE_PRIMARY_REPO_ROOT:-}"

# Run primary repo setup first.
npm install

# Loop through any additional repositories.
for prefix in ${VIBE_REPOSITORIES//,/ }; do
  path_var="VIBE_REPO_${prefix}_PATH"
  root_var="VIBE_REPO_${prefix}_ROOT"
  repo_path="${!path_var}"
  repo_root="${!root_var}"
  [ -n "${repo_path}" ] || continue
  (cd "${repo_path}/${repo_root:-}" && npm install)
done
```

```batch Setup script (Windows)
@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion

if defined VIBE_PRIMARY_REPO_ROOT (
  cd /d "%VIBE_PRIMARY_REPO_PATH%\%VIBE_PRIMARY_REPO_ROOT%"
) else (
  cd /d "%VIBE_PRIMARY_REPO_PATH%"
)

npm install

for %%P in (%VIBE_REPOSITORIES:,= %) do (
  set "repoPathVar=VIBE_REPO_%%P_PATH"
  for /f "tokens=1,* delims==" %%A in ('set !repoPathVar!') do set "repoPath=%%B"
  if defined repoPath (
    pushd "!repoPath!"
    npm install
    popd
  )
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Managing Multiple Repositories

Projects can reference more than one Git repository. This is useful when a feature spans a frontend and backend repo, or when only a subdirectory of a large monorepo should be exposed to agents.

### Adding repositories to an existing project

1. Open the project and choose **Repositories** in the detail view.
2. Click **Add repository** and fill in:
   - **Name** – how the repository appears in the switcher.
   - **Git repo path** – absolute path to the repository root on disk.
   - **Root path (optional)** – limit access to a subdirectory (e.g., `packages/web`). Leave blank to expose the full repo.
3. Mark one repository as **Primary**. Merge/push/PR actions operate on this repository.
4. Repeat for each additional repository you need. Task attempts will now clone all linked repos into sibling worktrees.

### Worked example: `web` + `core-api`

| Repository | Primary? | Git repo path      | Root path |
|------------|----------|--------------------|-----------|
| Web        | ✅       | `~/code/web`       | _(blank)_ |
| Core API   | ❌       | `~/code/core-api`  | _(blank)_ |

With this configuration:

- Agents receive environment variables such as `VIBE_REPO_WEB_PATH` and `VIBE_REPO_CORE_API_PATH` that point to each worktree.
- The repository switcher lets reviewers jump between diffs for `web` and `core-api`.
- Searches can be scoped per repository by selecting it in the toolbar.

If you only want a subdirectory of a monorepo, point **Git repo path** at the repo and set **Root path** to the folder you need (for example, `packages/mobile-app`). The worktree still clones the whole repository, but diffs and searches are rooted inside the subdirectory.

#### Agent runtime environment

Task attempts export several environment variables so coding agents can reliably discover every repository worktree:

- `VIBE_REPOSITORY_COUNT` reports how many repositories are linked to the attempt.
- `VIBE_REPOSITORIES` lists comma-separated prefixes (for example, `WEB,CORE_API`).
- `VIBE_REPO_<PREFIX>_PATH` gives the absolute worktree path for each repository.
- `VIBE_REPO_<PREFIX>_ROOT` scopes the repository to a subdirectory when a root override is configured; it is empty when the entire repository is exposed.
- `VIBE_REPO_<PREFIX>_NAME`, `VIBE_REPO_<PREFIX>_BRANCH`, and `VIBE_REPO_<PREFIX>_IS_PRIMARY` provide metadata so agents can choose sensible defaults and communicate which repo they are touching.
- `VIBE_PRIMARY_REPO_PREFIX`, `VIBE_PRIMARY_REPO_PATH`, and related variables mirror the same data for the primary repository specifically.

Prefixes use the repository name converted to uppercase snake_case and remain stable for the lifetime of the attempt. Agents should set the command `workdir` to the desired `VIBE_REPO_<PREFIX>_PATH` before running tools, especially when editing secondary repositories.

### How multi-repo attempts behave

- Every task attempt creates a worktree for each configured repository. Long-lived tasks therefore keep the different codebases in sync.
- Cleanup, setup, and dev server scripts run from the primary repository’s worktree. Use script logic (or custom scripts) if secondary repos need additional setup.
- Diffs, review comments, and file searches store repository metadata so you always know which repo a change belongs to.

### Limitations

- Merge, push, and pull request actions currently target the **primary** repository only. Commit or push changes in secondary repositories manually.
- All repositories are cloned for every attempt. Avoid adding repos you rarely need to reduce setup time.
- Dev server shortcuts run once; if your secondary repo needs a different server, add a custom script to start it.

### Upgrade notes

Multi-repository support requires new database tables. If you are upgrading an existing installation, run `npm run prepare-db` (or start the backend once) so migrations apply before linking additional repositories.
